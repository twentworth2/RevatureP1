# The Royal Mail Experience


## Project Description
We were tasked with creating an Experience Cloud as an external facing website for our customers to be able to view and edit their accounts and as well look up their packages. We also needed to create a Service Cloud that allowed our external users to connect with us and have their questions answered as well as problems resolved. We had to a Sales Cloud where we implemented a way to offer additional products to our customers. Finally we had to add automation to generally improve the lives of our users. This project built on our existing Postal Service application.
